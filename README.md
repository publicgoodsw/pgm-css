# pgm-css

This repository contains some useful files to aid in the creation of an external css file for the purpose of re-branding a custom Public Good Impact Unit (IU).  The latest version of the IU's styles.scss and compiled styles.css files are provided for reference while sample.css includes examples of some common css selectors for the IU.


## Getting started

1. Create and host a public css file (you can use sample.css to get started) on a webserver of your choosing.

2. Email support@publicgood.com with the URL for your css file and the name of the campaign that will reference this file.  Someone at Public Good will respond with a link to a demo page that can be used to test your custom css.
