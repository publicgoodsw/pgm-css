# pgm-css

This repository contains a sample file to aid in the creation of an external css file for the purpose of re-branding a custom Public Good Action Unit (AU).  The sample.css file includes examples of some common css selectors for the AU.


## Getting started

1. Create and host a public css file (you can use sample.css to get started) on a webserver of your choosing.

2. Email support@publicgood.com with the URL for your css file and the name of the campaign that will reference this file.  Someone at Public Good will respond with a link to a demo page that can be used to test your custom css.
